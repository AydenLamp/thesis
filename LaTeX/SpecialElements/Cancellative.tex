Throughout, let \(S\) be a semigroup with associative multiplication.

\begin{definition}[Right/left/two-sided cancellative element]
\label{def:cancellative-element}
Let \(s\in S\).
\begin{itemize}
  \item \(s\) is \emph{right cancellative} if for all \(x,y\in S\), \(x s = y s \implies x = y\).
  \item \(s\) is \emph{left cancellative} if for all \(x,y\in S\), \(s x = s y \implies x = y\).
  \item \(s\) is \emph{cancellative} (two-sided) if it is both left and right cancellative.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Right/left/two-sided cancellative semigroup]
\label{def:cancellative-semigroup}
A semigroup \(S\) is
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{right cancellative} if every \(s\in S\) is right cancellative,
  \item \emph{left cancellative} if every \(s\in S\) is left cancellative,
  \item \emph{cancellative} (two-sided) if every \(s\in S\) is cancellative.
\end{itemize}
